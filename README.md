# take-control-page
Chingu cohort tier 1 project on Clone the Lloyds of London Taking Control Page

- Remember that this is a clone. Even though you may prefer something different you should match the style of the Taking Control page as closely as possible. This includes layout, color scheme, and text content.

- Links on this page should be to corresponding content on the Lloyd's of London site. You do not need to replicate any content other than what's on the Taking Control page.

- The tabs section pops up additional links when the cursor hovers over it and the pop up disappears when the cursor moves out of the tab section. You should implement this effect for the 'News and risk insight' tab.
Create your own solution without looking at the page source for the site you are cloning.
